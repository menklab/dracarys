      <p>
        <span>

            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
            your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages
            that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you
            interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
          </span>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          <span>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</span>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>
          <span>
            - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
            identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
            http://www.allaboutcookies.org.

      <p>
        <span>
          <span>
            - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
            Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
          </span>
        </span>
      </p>
